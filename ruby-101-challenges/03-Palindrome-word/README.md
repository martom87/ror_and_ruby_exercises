## Background

A Palindrome is a word or phrase which reads the same backward or forward, such as madam or kayak.

## Specs

- Implement a Ruby method `palindrome?` that checks if a given word is a palindrome
- This method should take one argument (word), a `String`, and return a `Boolean` (true of false), telling us if the given word is a palindrome or not
- You can assume the one argument is a single word
- It should not be affected by capital letters

`palindrome?("racecar")` should return `true`

`palindrome?("wagon")` should return `false`

## Key Learning Points

- `String` methods
- `return` statement in methods
- Predicate methods (methods that return true or false)
