## Specs

- Implement a Ruby method `can_you_vote?` that `return`s `true` or `false` depending on the given age.
- This method should take one arguments (age), an `Integer`, and **return** a `Boolean` (`true`/`false`).

`can_you_vote?(18)` & `can_you_vote?(30)` should return `true`

`can_you_vote?(16)` should return `false`
