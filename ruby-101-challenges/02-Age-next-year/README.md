## Specs

- Implement a ruby method `#age_next_year` that returns a message telling you how old you'll be in a year.

`age_next_year(19)` should return:

`Next year I'll be 20 years old.`

`age_next_year(30)` should return:

`Next year I'll be 31 years old.`

## Key Learning Points

- `String` methods
- `String` interpolation
- `Integer` incrementation
- `return` statement in methods
