## Specs

- Implement a Ruby method `word_counter` that counts the number of words in a given sentence
- This method should take one argument (sentence), a `String`, and return an `Integer` representing the number of words in the sentence

`word_counter("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog")` should return `9`

`word_counter("Le Wagon")` should return `2`

## Key Learning Points

- `String` methods
- `return` statement in methods
- Chaining methods
